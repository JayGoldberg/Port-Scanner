# Simple Port Scanner

This is a simple port scanner script written in Bash that uses `netcat` (or `nc`) to scan a range of ports on a given IP address. The script checks if each port in the specified range is open or closed.

## Prerequisites

- `netcat` (or `nc`) must be installed on your system. You can check if it is installed by running `nc -h` in your terminal.
